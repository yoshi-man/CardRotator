# Card Flip Animation - Bulk-generating card flipping 3D animation GIFs

## Project Brief
Sticking to the theme of NFT's from a previous project, a lot of NFT projects lately are using 3D art to distinguish their project from others, this was the exact idea me and my friends had originally. We found a website (https://www.3dgifmaker.com/) that could help us do a 3D spinning card, but couldn't really generate them in bulk - we wanted to generate a few thousand of these .Having looked through so many libraries, I ended up coding the animation with OpenCV.


## What You'll Find Here

Here you'll find the Jupyter Notebook and folder structure needed to bulk generate GIFs that takes the input files labeled 1_front.jpg and 1_back.jpg and so on... and generates the output GIFs to the gifs_output folder.
